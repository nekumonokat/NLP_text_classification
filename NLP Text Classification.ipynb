    "This project provides an analysis of textual data on Twitter to accurately detect and classify threatening or harmful content using sentiment analysis techniques. This would provide the cybersecurity industry a tool that takes in a corpus of text for training to develop a strong detection system."

    "Due to popular algorithms being centered around the detection of cyberbullying on social media (Cynthia Van Hee et al., 2018), it is important for this project to widen the scope of detection. While the general detection algorithms focus mainly on terrorism and cyberbullying, it is a known fact that cybersecurity encompasses more than those 2 focuses. (Khairy, Mahmoud and Abd-El-Hafeez, 2021) While full security and safety of users cannot be ensured, making these adjustments would contribute valuable insights for future development."

    "To begin this project, an extensive amount of textual data corpora is required. After researching large datasets of Tweets, Sentiment140 on Kaggle was proven to be the best for this project. With 1.6 million tweets extracted using the Twitter API, the authors have categorised each tweet to have either a positive, neutral or negative sentiment, which is beneficial for the algorithm in categorising harmful texts.\n",

    "The dataset consists of the target (defined as the sentiment of the text), the tweet IDs, date, flags (possible queries, which would be removed in the initialisation phase of extracting the data), the username, and the text of the tweet."
